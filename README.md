    ## Installation
    Step 1. Since the  task was based on utilising node.js to create a readme file, the  first step was to create a  new repo, transport the  provided code and begin working on the code.

![starter index](./assets/images/starter%20index.png)

    Step 2. Once the Repo was created, the first step was utilising npm init -y and npm -y to ensure that the required node modules were transfered into the file.

    Step 3.  Now it was time to begin completing the functions in Index.js and complete the generateMarkdown.js file with the function that creates the markdown.

    Step 4. Once the functions were completed for the index.js, the next function required was to add the functions which generate the markdown and append the users answers to the questions in the CLI
